# GalleryNg

Special thanks to Kevin Sangurima, the guru of Angular who taught me all that I know! His help in debugging this project at various stages was vital.

GalleryNg is a collection of Angular projects, all of which make use of the HTML5 Canvas and use graphical and procedural generation concepts, to showcase algorithms I've learned.

Enjoy!
